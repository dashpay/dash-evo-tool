    Architecture Overview

    DashPay is a payment application built on Dash Platform that enables:
    - Contact requests between Dash identities
    - User profiles with avatars, display names, and bios
    - Direct settlement payment channels between contacts
    - Encrypted payment history between contacts

    Implementation Plan

    1. Create DashPay Module Structure

    - src/ui/dashpay/ - UI screens for DashPay features
      - mod.rs - Module exports
      - dashpay_screen.rs - Main DashPay screen with sub-tabs
      - contacts_list.rs - Display contacts and pending requests
      - contact_requests.rs - Send/receive contact requests
      - profile_screen.rs - View/edit user profile
      - contact_details.rs - View contact details and payment history
      - send_payment.rs - Send payment to a contact
      - contact_info_editor.rs - Edit contact nickname/notes

    2. Add Backend Tasks

    - src/backend_task/dashpay/ - Backend operations
      - mod.rs - Module exports
      - send_contact_request.rs - Create and broadcast contact request
      - accept_contact_request.rs - Accept incoming request
      - fetch_contact_requests.rs - Query incoming/outgoing requests
      - fetch_profiles.rs - Query user profiles
      - update_profile.rs - Update user's DashPay profile
      - fetch_contact_info.rs - Query contact info documents
      - update_contact_info.rs - Update contact nicknames/notes
      - send_payment_to_contact.rs - Send payment using contact's encrypted keys

    3. Add Database Tables

    - src/database/dashpay.rs - Persistence layer
      - dashpay_contacts table - Store contacts and their encrypted keys
      - dashpay_profiles table - Cache user profiles
      - dashpay_contact_requests table - Track pending requests
      - dashpay_payment_history table - Store payment history between contacts

    4. Update Navigation

    - Add DashPay to RootScreenType and ScreenType enums
    - Add DashPay icon to left panel navigation
    - Create subscreen chooser panel for DashPay sections

    5. UI Components

    The main DashPay screen will have tabs for:
    - Contacts - List of established contacts with quick pay buttons
    - Requests - Incoming/outgoing contact requests
    - Profile - Edit your public profile
    - Payments - Recent payment history

    6. Key Features to Implement

    - Contact request creation with encrypted extended public keys
    - Profile management (display name, avatar URL, bio)
    - Contact list with search/filter
    - Payment sending interface
    - Contact info editing (nicknames, notes, hidden status)
    - QR code scanning for auto-accept proof
    - Payment history per contact

    7. Placeholder Backend Functions

    Since not all SDK functionality may be available yet:
    - Use TODO comments for missing SDK methods
    - Create mock data structures where needed
    - Implement UI with simulated data for testing

    This approach follows the existing patterns in the codebase (similar to how tokens, identities, and DPNS are organized) and provides a complete UI framework 
    that can be connected to backend functionality as it becomes available.
