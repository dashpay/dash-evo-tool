echo "============================"

echo "This script analyzes the SPV header sync bug where an incorrect hash is used"
echo "in GetHeaders requests after syncing the first 2000 headers."

# Key information from the logs
LAST_STORED_HEIGHT=2000
LAST_STORED_HASH="0x0000001e340a0e6fb510d53c2316e8b0f3e27b2e6ee0002a23f228cfec723b06"
MYSTERY_HASH="0x00000014ae902cd16b2109ee531d006780ad3303af01e7b938e182c30c99f749"

echo "Bug Details:"
echo "- After syncing headers 0-2000 successfully"
echo "- Last stored header at height $LAST_STORED_HEIGHT"
echo "- Last stored hash: $LAST_STORED_HASH"
echo "- GetHeaders uses wrong hash: $MYSTERY_HASH"
echo ""

echo "Key Observations:"
echo "1. The mystery hash never appears in any previous header sync logs"
echo "2. It's not the hash of block 2000, 1999, or any nearby block"
echo "3. The hash has valid format (correct leading zeros for Dash)"
echo "4. This prevents further header syncing beyond height 2000"
echo ""

echo "Hypothesis:"
echo "This appears to be a bug in dash-spv's block locator generation algorithm."
echo "The locator hash should be from a recently synced block, but instead it's"
echo "using a hash that doesn't correspond to any block we've received."
echo ""

echo "Possible Root Causes:"
echo "1. Buffer overflow or uninitialized memory being read"
echo "2. Incorrect index calculation when building block locators"
echo "3. State corruption in the header chain storage"
echo "4. Wrong endianness or byte order when reading stored headers"
echo ""

echo "Next Steps for Investigation:"
echo "1. Add detailed logging to dash-spv's locator generation code"
echo "2. Dump the block locator array to see all hashes being used"
echo "3. Verify the header storage integrity at height 2000"
echo "4. Check if this hash exists anywhere in the SPV storage files"
echo ""

echo "Workaround Options:"
echo "1. Detect when GetHeaders uses an invalid hash and restart sync"
echo "2. Implement custom header request logic bypassing dash-spv"
echo "3. Pre-populate SPV storage with known good headers"
echo "4. Use a checkpoint closer to the tip to avoid this issue"

echo "Summary:"
echo "This is clearly a bug in dash-spv that needs to be fixed upstream."
echo "The library is generating an invalid block locator after syncing headers."
