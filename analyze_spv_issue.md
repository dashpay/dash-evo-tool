# SPV Header Sync Issue Analysis

## Problem Summary
The SPV module is not receiving header responses from peers, causing sync to be stuck at height 0.

## Key Differences Observed

### Working Demo (Colleague's Output)
- Uses **"GetHeaders"** protocol message
- Receives responses: "Handle headers message with 2000 headers"
- Successfully syncs headers from peers
- Shows progressive height updates

### Our Implementation (Current Issue)
- Appears to use **"GetHeaders2"** protocol message
- No header responses received
- Stuck at height 0
- Peers seem to ignore our requests

## Potential Root Causes

1. **Protocol Version Mismatch**
   - Our client might be using a newer protocol version (GetHeaders2) that peers don't support
   - Most Dash mainnet nodes might only support the older GetHeaders protocol

2. **Message Format Issue**
   - GetHeaders2 might have different message format/parameters
   - Peers might not recognize or validate our requests

3. **Peer Compatibility**
   - The peers we're connecting to might be running older versions
   - They might not support the protocol version we're using

## Recommended Solutions

### 1. Force Older Protocol Version
Check if dash-spv has a configuration option to:
- Use older protocol version
- Force GetHeaders instead of GetHeaders2
- Set compatibility mode

### 2. Test with Different Networks
- Try testnet first (might have more compatible peers)
- Compare protocol messages between networks

### 3. Debug Protocol Negotiation
Use the debug scripts to:
- Monitor exact protocol messages sent/received
- Check version negotiation during handshake
- Identify where communication breaks down

### 4. Check dash-spv Library Version
- Ensure we're using a compatible version of dash-spv
- Compare with the version used in the working demo

## Action Items

1. Run `./debug_spv_protocol.sh` to capture detailed protocol messages
2. Look for "Send getheaders2" vs "Send getheaders" in logs
3. Check if peers respond with version/protocol errors
4. Consider downgrading or patching dash-spv to use GetHeaders

## Notes
- Most mainnet nodes are at height ~2.29M and don't serve full history
- The protocol version issue might explain why peers don't respond
- This is likely not a network/firewall issue since connections are established
