echo "ISSUE: Mainnet SPV sync fails because:"
echo "1. dash-spv requests headers starting from genesis (block 0)"
echo "2. Mainnet nodes only serve recent blocks (from ~height 2.29M)"
echo "3. Nodes ignore requests for genesis headers, causing timeout"
echo ""
echo "WORKAROUND: Use Testnet network instead"
echo ""
echo "To reproduce the issue:"
echo "1. Start dash-evo-tool"
echo "2. Select Mainnet network"
echo "3. Click 'Initialize SPV'"
echo "4. Click 'Start SPV Sync'"
echo "5. Watch logs - you'll see repeated 'Phase Downloading Headers timed out'"
echo ""
echo "To use the workaround:"
echo "1. Start dash-evo-tool"
echo "2. Select Testnet network (it serves full history)"
echo "3. Click 'Initialize SPV'"
echo "4. Click 'Start SPV Sync'"
echo "5. Headers should start syncing properly"
