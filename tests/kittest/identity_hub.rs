//! Integration tests for the new unified Identities hub.
//!
//! Each test mounts the full `AppState`, switches the selected root screen to
//! `RootScreenIdentityHub`, and asserts that the expected tab structure renders.
//!
//! This is the minimum kittest coverage for the scaffold. Per-tab assertions on
//! the full populated layouts arrive as each tab's content lands (T8–T11).
